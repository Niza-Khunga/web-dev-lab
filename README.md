This is a lab demonstrating the setting up of a web development environment on Github.
The three main tools were preinstalled on my devices and Git as well as Github was already setup.
An HTML file was created and was uploaded to web-dev-lab.git.
A file called hello.txt was created as well as a feature branch with a feature.txt file.
The feature-branch was merged via a pull request.
My partner (Faith Mayani's) repo was cloned and the necessary alterations were made.
A Pull request was created to merge the changes.
